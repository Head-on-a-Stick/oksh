Dependencies
------------
A C99 compiler is the easiest way to ensure that `oksh` will build correctly.
Please see the list of C compilers above for a list of known working compilers.

Though not required, the `ncurses` library will be used for screen clearing
routines if the library is found during the `configure` stage. This can be
turned off by the user by passing the `--disable-curses` flag to `configure`.

A `configure` script that produces a `POSIX` `Makefile` is provided to
ease building and installation and can be run by:
```
$ ./configure
$ make && sudo make install
```

In case of emergency
--------------------
If you cannot execute `make` for whatever reason, a rescue script,
`rescue.sh`, is available. This script contains nothing more than a
hand-written list of compiler invocations which will build `oksh` in the
most basic and portable way possible. This rescue shell is perfectly
usable (as it is just an unoptimized build).
