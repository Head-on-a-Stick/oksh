Dependencies
------------
A C compiler that understands the `long long` type. A C99 compiler is the
easiest way to ensure that `oksh` will build correctly. Please see the
list of C compilers above for a list of known working compilers.

A `configure` script that produces a `POSIX` `Makefile` is provided to
ease building and installation and can be run by:
```
$ ./configure
$ make && sudo make install
```

In case of emergency
--------------------
If you cannot execute `make` for whatever reason, a rescue script,
`rescue.sh`, is available. This script contains nothing more than a
hand-written list of compiler invocations which will build `oksh` in the
most basic and portable way possible. This rescue shell is perfectly
usable (as it is just an unoptimized build).
